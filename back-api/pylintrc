# W0201 | Class attribute defined outside '__init__' method
# W0212 | Access to a protected member %s of a client class
# W0613 | Used when a function or method argument is not used.

# E0401 | Used when pylint has been unable to import a module.
# E1101 | Used when a variable is accessed for an unexistent member.
# E1102 | Used when an object being called has been inferred to a non callable object.

# I0011 | Used when an inline option disables a message or a messages category.
# I1101 | Used when a variable is accessed for non-existent member of C extension.

# C0103 | Used when the name doesn't conform to naming rules associated to its type (constant, variable, class...).
# C0111 | Used when a module, function, class or method has no docstring.
# C0321 | More than one statement on a single line
# C0330 | Wrong continuing logical indentation.

# R0201 | Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as a function.
# R0901 | Used when class has too many parent classes, try to reduce this to get a simpler (and so easier to use) class.

# R0914 | Used when a function or method has too many local variables.
# R0915 | Used when a function or method has too many statements. Try to split it in smaller functions / methods.
